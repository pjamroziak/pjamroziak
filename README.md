### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was interested in programming even as a kid. I can still remember the first C++ lessons in elementary school! You could describe me as a stubborn self-learner â€” thereâ€™s no technology or language I couldnâ€™t learn. Stereotypically, I love playing video games on consoles. But not that long ago I got a new hobby â€” making custom computer water cooling systems. In the evenings, you can usually find me with fantasy or crime novels on a couch.

Hobbies:
- Making water cooling custom loops for PCs
- Reverse engineering of serial communication devices
- Playing video games and guitar
